# SPH-Taichi

An implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in fluid simulation using Taichi. Based on [Taichi Course 01: (10) Fluid Simulation](https://github.com/taichiCourse01/taichiCourse01).

Weekly Compressible SPH has been implemented. Other SPH methods like IISPH, DFSPH are being worked on.
